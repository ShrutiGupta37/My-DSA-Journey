# ðŸ“’ Array Basics and Operations in C

This document serves as both a **reference** and **study material** for understanding **array operations** in C . It includes theory, code behavior, and complexity analysis to help you master array manipulation in a structured way.

## ðŸ”¶ What is an Array?

An **array** is a collection of similar data types stored at contiguous memory locations. Arrays are indexed, and elements can be accessed randomly using their index.

### Key Points:
- All elements must be of the **same type** (e.g., int, float).
- Stored in **contiguous memory locations**.
- Supports **random access** using index.
- Static arrays have **fixed size**, defined at compile time.

## ðŸ§  Time and Space Complexity (Explained)

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| Traverse  | O(n)             | O(1)             | Scans and prints each element |
| Insert    | O(n)             | O(1)             | Shifts elements to make space |
| Delete    | O(n)             | O(1)             | Shifts elements to fill gap |
